# SQL EDA Sales Analytics Project

## Project Summary
This project demonstrates an end-to-end **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** workflow using **SQL** on a structured sales data warehouse. It captures key business metrics, analyzes trends, and provides insights into customer, product, and revenue behavior using real analytical queries.

The focus of this project is to showcase practical SQL skills used in real business analysis — such as aggregations, joins, grouping, ranking, and time-based trend analysis — which are essential for **Data Analyst** roles.
